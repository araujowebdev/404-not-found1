# 404 Not Found

This is a simple project of a 404 Error Page Not Found. It was used the basics of any web page (html and css), where I used a little Sass. I also used Gulp to compile from .scss to .css.

This project is a challenge from <a target="_blank" href="https://devchallenges.io/">devChallenges</a> where I took only the design and developed all the code.
