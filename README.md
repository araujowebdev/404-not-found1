# 404 Not Found

This is a simple project of a 404 Error Page Not Found. It was used the basics of any web page (html and css), where I used a little Sass.

I used Flex Box to organize all the content on the page and make it responsive.

I also used Gulp to compile from .scss to .css.

This project is a challenge from <a target="_blank" href="https://devchallenges.io/">devChallenges</a> where I took only the design and developed all the code.
